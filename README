Allergy Helper is going to be a diagnosis helping tool.

The idea is that the user will enter their exposure to various things (anything they've eaten or had contact with that they might be allergic to), and then their symptoms. Each entry will be dated, so hopefully it will help narrow down things and find correlations between exposure and allergic reaction.

I have no medical background whatsoever, but hopefully that won't matter. The idea isn't to provide a diagnosis per se, just to correlate exposures to allergic reactions.
